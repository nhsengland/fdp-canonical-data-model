# Federated Data Platform - Canonical Data Model

The Federated Data Platform (FDP) Canonical Data Model (CDM) is rooted in the logical CDM. The logical CDM represents and captures data across the NHS estate and helps to standardise data collected, stored, and disseminated by various platforms and products. This is being developed by the NHS and dictates the data structure for products developed in the FDP. The FDP CDM model is developed based on the logical CDM. Any alterations to meet performance or application requirements will be logged and reconsolidated with the model. Details as to how the logical CDM will shape its implementation on FDP will be published when the logical CDM is released.

Any updates made to the FDP CDM will be published to the GitHub repository on a monthly basis. The intent is to expand the CDM aligned to products in current development. Proposed updates will be assessed to avoid the need for any breaking changes unless deemed absolutely necessary.
